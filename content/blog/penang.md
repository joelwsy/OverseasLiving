###### What pops into your mind when you first heard about "Penang"? Delicacies? Heritage architecture? Penang Hill, seasides, and national park?

Penang is located in the north part of the Peninsular Malaysia and George Town is the capital city. It was once an important Straits of Malacca trading hub, and the cityâ€™s old town is known for its British colonial buildings, Chinese shophouses and mosques. Nowadays, George Town is a modern city with skyscrapers, condominiums, and shopping malls. It is connected to the Malaysia Peninsula by two main road bridges, Penang Bridge and the Sultan Abdul Halim Muadzam Shah Bridge (Penang Second Bridge).

Georgetown was listed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in July 2008. It plays a vital role of Malaysian art and culture center, which is a melting pot of diversity and cultures. From unique street arts, preservation of heritage buildings, to vibrant lifestyles of local people, Penang is deeply fascinating.

Penang is known as the "Pearl of the Orient" by Western tourists and praised by Easterners as a "food paradise". It has a mixture of variety: Malay, Chinese, Indian, Nyonya, Western, Japanese, Korean and many more. Teochew Cendol and fried kuey teow are a must-eat in Penang. You would never want to leave Penang without trying Penang food.

Many local artists participated in leaving a mural on the walls of Georgetown. These artists used their imagination to draw the mural in every corner of the city. IBicycle is one of the fresco themes here. Tourists can rent and ride bicycles around the heritage old town, to admire more than 100+ street arts. I believe young people will love it.
