#### Short Stay

What is Malaysia like? Where is Penang? For those who are interested in living in Malaysia but feeling anxious and not well-prepared for the transition that you will be going through, it is perfect for you to start by trying a short stay experience (one to three months) in Malaysia.
For short stay, visitors are encouraged to rent a condominium. Condos that we are offering will be a fully furnished unit with furniture and electric appliances. You may enjoy your stay in Malaysia immediately upon your arrival.

Recently, many people from cold countries come to Malaysia for short stay during winter season in their home countries. If you want to plan for a short stay in Malaysia during winter season in your home country, we recommend you to plan early. The peak seasons in Malaysia are January to March, July to August, November to December.

###### CONDOMINIUM

Condominiums mainly comprising 2-3 rooms including kitchen, furniture, home appliances, and kitchenware. We provides prior arrival inspection to make sure your reserved units are in proper condition, and you may immediately start your stay in a comfortable and clean environment.

###### DAILY LIFE

In most of the residential areas, essential facilities and services such as morning markets for fresh groceries, local supermarket, hypermarkets, banks and post offices are nearby for your convenience and comfort. If you do not have a car, there are public transport services like Rapid bus, “Grab” or “CAT” (free bus services by the state government)!
